# Voting behaviour in Dutch Parliament

In the age of information, providing voters with accessible and comprehensive statistics is crucial for fostering an informed electorate. I made a visualisation website that explores the behaviour of all fractions of the Dutch Parliament -- specifically, how they correlate over the years. This visualisation is available as [Python code](https://github.com/larsgeb/Polertiek), or simply the [interactive website](https://protected-sea-76942-d6d7d105e2ef.herokuapp.com)! It aims to show what parties do, not what they say.

The app is built using:
- Flask
- Numpy
- Scikit
- Scipy
- Pandas
- sqlite3
- git-lfs
- heroku
- plotly.js
- Jupyter


Note that of course this wouldn't be possible without the [permissive dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UXIBNO) (CC BY 4.0) from [Louwerse et al.](http://rdcu.be/o6TC)!
